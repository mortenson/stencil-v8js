# stencil-v8js
Playground for v8js + StencilJS

# Instructions

1. Install PHP
1. Install the v8js extension *
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run build`
1. Run `php v8js.php`
1. Hopefully, at some point, see the output of a rendered Stencil component!

\* If you're on OS X and use Homebrew, just run `brew install php71-v8js`. If
you're on anything else, you'll probably need to compile the extension by hand.
See [phpv8/v8js](https://github.com/phpv8/v8js) for instructions.
